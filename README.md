+ Project summary: We were tasked with A1 and A4. Task A1 focused on implementing the Learning Fair Representations (LFR) algorithm from Zemel et al. (2013). LFR is a machine learning technique designed to reduce bias in predictive modeling. This project involved developing a Python notebook that allowed us to apply LFR to the COMPAS Recidivism Risk Score Data and Analysis dataset. The primary goal of the algorithm is to enhance the fairness of models by ensuring they do not perpetuate or exacerbate biases present in the training data. This implementation involved cleaning/preprocessing the data, coding the given LFR algorithm, and testing its effectiveness on the given dataset. A4 aimed to develop a Python-based solution for advanced fairness in machine learning models by implementing the principles of DM (Disparate Mistreatment) and DM-sen (Disparate Mistreatment considering sensitive attributes), which go beyond traditional approaches like disparate treatment and disparate impact. The goal was to create algorithms that ensure fairness in classification tasks by minimizing bias not just in treatment and impact but also in the errors (mistreatments) the model makes.
